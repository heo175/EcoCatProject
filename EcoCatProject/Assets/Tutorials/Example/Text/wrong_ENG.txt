Developer:There may be several reasons
Developer:There are three major things to check first
Traveler:What is this?
Developer:Image array, Dialog file, ChoiceSentence array
Developer:The majority of problems arise when the size of the array does not match
Developer:Therefore, you need to make the image array size equal to the number of dialog file conversations.
Developer:In the case of an image, it may be empty in the middle, but the selection array must not be empty in the middle
Developer:Finally, image arrays, dialog files, and selection arrays All arrays must be left blank at the end because the last line is needed to end the conversation
Developer:I want to check it and fix it.
Developer:Do you have any more questions?
