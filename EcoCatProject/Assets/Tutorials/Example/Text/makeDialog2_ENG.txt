Developer:Just open Notepad and write it this way
Developer:What do you think? Easy?
Traveler:Yeah So simple.
Developer:If another images is prepare, you can create a Dialog in earnest.
Developer:Design is free! If there is a place with name and dialogue there is no problem.
Developer:However, the recommended way is put the dialog object at the top of the list as shown in the example scene
Developer:We recommend that you put the objects that make up the dialog box as children. That's why it's easy to manage later.
Developer:First, we make the background part of the dialog window an image object
Developer:Put SimpleDialogMgr, the main of this asset
Traveler:Is there a reason to insert a script in the background of the dialog?
Developer:No reason. It does not matter where you put it But Don't put objects that are disabled or deleted
Developer:And then Create two Text objects as children of the image object
Developer:One is where the name is printed and the other is where the dialogue is printed
Developer:You can customize size, font, and color of Text objects.
Developer:And turn off the Best Fit setting in the Text component of the Text object that outputs the dialogue.
Developer:Next, there are illustrations and a few buttons. These may exist or may not exist.
Developer:nextButton is important. But If you do not want to make it, you can replace it with a keyboard button. 
Developer:That is why I am hard more to say and See the Guide Book for the rest.
Developer:Do you have any more questions?
